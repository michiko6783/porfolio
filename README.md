This is my portfolio to display all my works and information while attending
General Assembly web development immersive.

The color wheel is layed out with a unseen background so that I had a hard
line to follow when building using nothing but CSS. Each section is a 
custom shaped polygons to give the angles and layered using z-index. 

I wanted to give the appearence of it turning slightly by making the 
colors rotate with CSS animation so that each section has to change and
cycle through all five colors, in order of the colors it starts on. This
unfortunately prevented my code from being as DRY as I would like.

I then layered another container on top for the text links, placing them
'inside' the colored blocks. Each is linked to it's respective location:
Resume will take you to an online copy of my resume. The About Me will
direct to my GA Profile page. Projects directs to my gitHub profile, and
Blog takes you to my professional blog on Medium.com. All links open to 
a new tab so there is no need to back up to the main page.

I decided to make the Contact link a drop down instead since my contact 
information is on my resume but the hover dropdown is a quick reference 
the page.
